**Final_code.ipynb** is the main file that consists of training the model with various datasets.

The complete process and details of our project is summarized in **details.txt**.

Apart from the Final_code.ipynb to further analyze the multilinguality we trained our model using 3 different languages other 
than the languages given in the paper and at last we tested the multilinguality by testing the model with a test dataset of french language.
You can find that code in **Multilingual(1).ipynb**.

The techniques we used to add noise to our data are present in **robust.ipynb**.

And finally all the datasets used for the implementation of our project are present in the **datasets folder**.

**Contribution:**
All of our teammates contributed equally in implementing the project.
